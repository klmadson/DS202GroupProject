## Outline of Exploration 

> Step 1: With the given data, we are trying to generate predicted final grades of students in order to define a pattern through the variables in this data set. The variables that we would like to utlize are 
- School
- Age
- Sex
- FamSize
- P Status
- Fjob, Mjob
- Reason
- Guardian
> We will convert these character variables as factors in order to better analyze the data.

> Step 2: Secondly, we would like the convert the below provided variables from binary "Yes and No" to 1 and 0.
- Schoolsup
- Famsup
- Activities
- Nursery
- Higher
- Internet
- Romantic
- Paid

> Step 3: Once the above steps are completed, we believe, we could then go ahead and change the name of these variables in order to help viewers understand the meaning of each variable and the reasons we have taken them into consideration.

> Step 4: Hypothesis Testing - 

> Step 5: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of grades to get an average score of each student's predicted final grades

> Step 6: Representing data can then be done by creating plots using ggplot2. This package will be utlized to create;
- Box plots
- Pie charts
- Bar graphs 
- Scatter plots
