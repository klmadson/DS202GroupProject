## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Outline of Exploration 

> Step 1: With the given data, we are trying to generate predicted final grades of students in order to define a pattern through the variables in this data set. The variables that we would like to utlize are 
- School
- Age
- Sex
- FamSize
- P Status
- Fjob, Mjob
- Reason
- Guardian
> We will convert these character variables as factors in order to better analyze the data.

> Step 2: Secondly, we would like the convert the below provided variables from binary "Yes and No" to 1 and 0.
- Schoolsup
- Famsup
- Activities
- Nursery
- Higher
- Internet
- Romantic
- Paid

> Step 3: Once the above steps are completed, we believe, we could then go ahead and change the name of these variables in order to help viewers understand the meaning of each variable and the reasons we have taken them into consideration.

> Step 4: Representing data can then be done by creating plots using ggplot2. This code would be utlized to create;
- Box plots
- Pie charts
- Bar graphs 
- Scatter plots
